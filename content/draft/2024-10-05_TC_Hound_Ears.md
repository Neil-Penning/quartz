## Under 18:
> Under 18—are you a minor?
> IF YOU’RE UNDER 18, you MUST download the attached waiver form and have a parent fill it out. You must then bring it with you to the check-in at the Grandfather Campground on the day of the event, or at pre-registration on the evening before the competition. You must have someone 18 or older to accompany you as your guardian.
